When investigating all components and technical installations of a building one can learn how to use what is normally hidden as a visible and intended part of a design. A pipe or tube has aesthetic values that can be used when not covered. The students where given an existing material with the assignment to give it a new purpose than what it was made for as a way to exercise a sustainable design thinking.
