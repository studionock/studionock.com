# RÖR WORKSHOP

NOCK held a 4 days workshop for all Architecture and Architecture and Engineering first year students at Chalmers University of Technology. The workshop focused on hidden building components, tubes and pipes, and on how to revalue and work with them in a new way. The task was to study the assigned materials properties and create spatial installations as a derive from their findings.

When investigating all components and technical installations of a building one can learn how to use what is normally hidden as a visible and intended part of a design. A pipe or tube has aesthetic values that can be used when not covered. The students where given an existing material with the assignment to give it a new purpose than what it was made for as a way to exercise a sustainable design thinking.
