We had a great time holding an introduction workshop for all Architecture and Architecture and Engineering first year students at Chalmers University of Technology.

The workshop focused on hidden building components, tubes and pipes, and on how to revalue and work with them in a new way. The task was to study the assigned materials properties and create spatial installations as a derive from their findings.The workshop was made in collaboration with [Hydroscand Sverige](https://www.facebook.com/HydroscandSverige/?fref=mentions), Scandicore and [Pipelife Sverige AB](https://www.facebook.com/Pipelife-Sverige-AB-128151230577851/?fref=mentions).
