The festival, through its OPEN WEEK, will include the annual degree show for Design, the Open House day and extend to a series of exhibitions, workshops, educational classes and talks. During this week, HDK and partners will provide access to a range of events that disseminate and generate further insight to HDK’s creative output and teachings in relation to the theme of ‘Open’.”
