Hi!

Studio Nock is an independent gallery project. We want to showcase ideas and work that can in uence and inspire the architectural discourse. The project will function as a platform where good projects can be shown and great ideas can be heard. We will look for content in Sweden and abroad. We will collect material from the archives, present new talents and discuss visions. We strive to establish contact with as many  elds as possible and we want to connect people that can reach further in a collaboration.

Hope that you want to join us in this!
