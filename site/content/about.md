Studio NOCK is an independent platform for architecture; a space for exhibition with an ambition to become a hub in the city. We operate as an informal extension of the academy, a venue for public conversation and a meeting place for everyone interested in architecture. Exhibitions are our way to reach out and gather people. Our job is to look for ideas and work that can influence and inspire the architectural practice and discourse, to find architectural ingenuity and give it the exposure it deserves. In a time of change and expansion, Studio NOCK strives to contribute to a positive momentum, in Scandinavia and the rest of the world.

Studio NOCK is a non-profit association run by Agnes Gidenstam and Naima Callenberg.
