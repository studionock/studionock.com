MIGRANT JOURNAL explores the circulation of people, goods, informa- tion, but also fauna and  ora, around the world and the transformative impact they have on space. While migration is part of humanity’s genesis, it seems the phenomenon has become ubiquitous, happening faster, with complex ramiifcations.

MIGRANT aims at exploring the relationship between these elements, events, journeys and spaces bound under the idea of ‘migration’ in all its forms, crucial to understand today’s society.

In order to break from the prejudices and clichés of migrants and migra- tion, MIGRANT asks artists, journalists, academics, designers, architects, philosophers, activists and citizens to rethink our approach to migration and critically explore the new spaces it creates.

PAPER is a monthly independent architecture magazine.

We work to deepen the interdisciplinary understanding of architecture. It is our professional practice and something we believe concerns us all as human beings engaging with our surroundings.

We strive to broaden the common understanding of architecture by facili- tating a debate about our built environment. Each issue of PAPER discus- ses a speci c theme through interviews, conversations or essays.

PAPER is printed as a visually engaging double sided A4 and written in a language accessible to the curious non-specialist.

Team: Christina Kousgaard, Samuel Michaëlsson, Hugo Losman Nädele, Mandeep Sing
